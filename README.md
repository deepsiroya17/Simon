# Simon Game
<h2>Summary</h2>
This is an interactive Simon Game written in JavaScript/CSS/HTML to simulate the classic Simon Electronic Memory Game.

<h2>How to play</h2>
The game has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated. A round in the game consists of lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.
